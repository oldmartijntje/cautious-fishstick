This project is me learning rust.

It is a ffmpeg wrapper.

I followed ~~[this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72PyU1EIGY8)~~ [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQ4hLB2IMw) for the Iced UI tutorial.
The striked through video used outdated `iced` version which `x11` on ubuntu had issues with. 
This new tutorial is also more in sync with my main goal for this application.
And it is a more "beginner friendly" tutorial since the narrator is explaining things.
